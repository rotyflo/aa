# Exercises

### Map By Name

Write a method map_by_name  that takes in an array of hashes and returns a new array containing the names of each hash.

### Map By Key

Write a method map_by_key that takes in an array of hashes and a key string. The method should returns a new array containing the values from each hash for the given key.

### Yell Sentence

Write a method yell_sentence that takes in a sentence string and returns a new sentence where every word is yelled. See the examples. Use map to solve this.

### Whisper Words

Write a method whisper_words that takes in an array of words and returns a new array containing a whispered version of each word. See the examples. Solve this using map :).

### O Words

Write a method o_words that takes in a sentence string and returns an array of the words that contain an "o". Use select in your solution!

### Last Index

Write a method last_index that takes in a string and a character. The method should return the last index where the character can be found in the string.

### Most Vowels

Write a method most_vowels that takes in a sentence string and returns the word of the sentence that contains the most vowels.

### Prime

Write a method prime? that takes in a number and returns a boolean, indicating whether the number is prime. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

### Pick Primes

Write a method pick_primes that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers.

### Prime Factors

Write a method prime_factors that takes in a number and returns an array containing all of the prime factors of the given number.

### Greatest Factor Array

Write a method greatest_factor_array that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array where every even number is replaced with it's greatest factor. A greatest factor is the largest number that divides another with no remainder. For example the greatest factor of 16 is 8. (For the purpose of this problem we won't say the greatest factor of 16 is 16, because that would be too easy, ha)

### Perfect Square

Write a method perfect_square? that takes in a number and returns a boolean indicating whether it is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that results from multiplying a number by itself. For example, 9 is a perfect square because 3  3 = 9, 25 is a perfect square because 5  5 = 25.

### Triple Sequence

Write a method triple_sequence that takes in two numbers, start and length. The method should return an array representing a sequence that begins with start and is length elements long. In the sequence, every element should be 3 times the previous element. Assume that the length is at least 1.

### Summation Sequence

A number's summation is the sum of all positive numbers less than or equal to the number. For example: the summation of 3 is 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, the summation of 6 is 21 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. Write a method summation_sequence that takes in a two numbers: start and length. The method should return an array containing length total elements. The first number of the sequence should be the start number. At any point, to generate the next element of the sequence we take the summation of the previous element. You can assume that length is not zero.

### Fibonacci

The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers whose first and second elements are 1. To generate further elements of the sequence we take the sum of the previous two elements. For example the first 6 fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Write a method fibonacci that takes in a number length and returns the fibonacci sequence up to the given length.

### Caesar Cipher

Write a method caesar_cipher that takes in a string and a number. The method should return a new string where every character of the original is shifted num characters in the alphabet.

### Vowel Cipher

Write a method vowel_cipher that takes in a string and returns a new string where every vowel becomes the next vowel in the alphabet.
